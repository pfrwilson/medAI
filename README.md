# medAI

Repo for my Ph.D research in AI for ultrasound-based prostate cancer detection. This repo aims to provide a code library supporting deep learning model development, datasets, data preprocessing, and model training and evaluation utilities (`medAI/medAI`). In addition, it hosts projects which build on top of the library.
